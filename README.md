# Automatic HUD for PaleoQuest - Second Life

These codes do **not require debit permission** yet, but **require RLV permissions** to protect the user.

This HUD is created with the same functions as the creators of the LSL language. Without an external software yet.

These codes are attached to the HUD, they make most of it automatic, in order to quickly complete the missions.
